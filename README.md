# UDEND Sparkify Data Lake Project with Apache Spark
The purpose of this project is to build an ETL pipeline that will be able to extract song and log data from an S3 bucket, process the data using Spark and load the data back into s3 as a set of dimensional tables in spark parquet files. This helps analysts to continue finding insights on what their users are listening to.

## Database Schema Design
The tables created include one fact table, `songplays` and four dimensional tables namely `users`, `songs`, `artists` and `time`. This follows the star schema principle which will contain clean data that is suitable for OLAP(Online Analytical Processing) operations which will be what the analysts will need to conduct to find the insights they are looking for.

## ETL Pipeline
The data gets that gets extracted will need to be transformed to to fit the data model in the target destination tables. For instance the source data for timestamp is in unix format and that will need to be converted to timestamp from which the year, month, day, hour values etc can be extracted which will fit in the relevant target time and songplays table columns. The script will also need to cater for duplicates, ensuring that they aren't part of the final data that is loaded in the tables.

## Datasets used
The datasets used are retrieved from the s3 bucket and are in the JSON format. There are two datasets namely `log_data` and `song_data`. The `song_data` dataset is a subset of the the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/) while the `log_data` contains generated log files based on the songs in `song_data`.

## Project Files
### etl.py
This script once executed retrieves the song and log data in the s3 bucket, transforms the data into fact and dimensional tables then loads the table data back into s3 as parquet files. 

### dl.cfg
Will contain your AWS keys.

## Getting Started
In order to have a copy of the project up and running locally, you will need to take note of the following:

### Prerequisites
   - Python 2.7 or greater.
   - AWS Account.

   - Set your AWS access and secret key in the config file. 
        ```
        [AWS]
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = <your aws key>
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = <your aws secret>
        ```

### Installation
   - Make a new directory and clone/copy project files into it.
   - Download and install Apache Spark here https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html. Also ensure you have Java jdk8 installed locally.
   - Create a virtualenv that will be your development environment, i.e:
       ```
       $ virtualenv data-lakes-project
       $ source data-lakes-project/bin/activate
       ```
   - Install the following packages in your virtual environment:

            - pyspark

- Alternatively you can install the requirements in the `requirements.txt` that's in this project by running the command:
    ```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
            
### Terminal commands
- Execute the ETL pipeline script by running:
    ```
    $ python etl.py
    ```
